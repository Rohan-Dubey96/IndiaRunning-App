# IndiaRunning-App
India Running is a Race registration platform powered by the Organiser dashboard which is used to provide the details about the Race and the configuration. I just need to write an Automation script which will enable adding a race to the platform using the Organiser dashboard and verify that the race is listed on India Running Staging website.

This project contains end-to-end UI test automation for the IndiaRunning web application using **Playwright with TypeScript**, along with **Allure Reports** for rich visual test reporting.
